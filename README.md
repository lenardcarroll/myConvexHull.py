# myConvexHull.py

My convex script generally works by using the command:

```
python -i myConvexHull.py -print <Y or N> -save <Y or N> -conf <Y or N> -plot <Y or N>
```

```<-print>``` - Choose if you want to print the convex points to the console. Y for print, N for don't print.
```<-save>``` - Choose if you want to save the convex points. Y for save, N for don't save.
```<-conf>``` - If Y, the script will confirm that no points lie outside the convex, if it does, it will let you know. N is used to not do the check.
```<-plot>``` - Specify if you want to plot your coordinates, with the convex points highlighted. Default is Y (yes).
